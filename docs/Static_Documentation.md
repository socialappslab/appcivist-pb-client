# How to create Swagger based documentation on a Static HTML file

All you need to generate the static HMTL is the JSON file created by Swagger

1. Spectacles

Simply install Spectacle from `npm` Â typing:

``` 
npm install -g spectacle-docs
```

Next you need to pass the JSON file to generate the HTML typing:

```
spectacle -d doc.json
```

The documentation will be located in the public directory by default.
